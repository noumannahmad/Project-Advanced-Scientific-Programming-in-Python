#Introduction

COVID-19 is a deadly disease that has affected the world, causing millions of infections and deaths. To prevent the spread of this disease, the World Health Organization recommends wearing masks in public places. Artificial intelligence, specifically computer vision, is being used to automatically detect whether people are wearing masks or not. Machine learning techniques are also being used, but deep learning models are producing remarkable results as they can extract features and classify images automatically.


# Problem Statement

The existing code lacks proper organization and documentation, making it difficult to read and comprehend. Additionally, it is not very efficient in terms of memory usage and processing speed.


# Methodology or Solution

My intention is to restructure and transform this code into a Python package that consists of separate modules, classes, and functions. This will make the code more readable and concise, and avoid duplicate functions and variables, resulting in more maintainable and scalable code. I will also ensure proper documentation wherever necessary to make the code more understandable and accessible. Additionally, I plan to leverage high-performance computing, such as GPU acceleration, and parallel programming to expedite certain computations and optimize the overall framework for efficiency. To achieve this, I intend to employ three deep learning models, namely VGG-16, Resnet-50, GoogleNet, and MobileNet, to build a Face Mask Detection System using Convolutional Neural Networks. Furthermore, I plan to incorporate advanced visualization tools, relevant to the General Problem Statement, to aid in visualization.
